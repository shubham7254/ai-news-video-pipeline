    "content": "Self-driving truck startup TuSimple (now CreateAI) sent a trove of sensitive data \u2013 effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system \u2013 to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe transfers to Chinese truck manufacturer Foton happened around February 2022, just a week after TuSimple signed the agreement in which U.S. regulators ordered the company to separate its business and technology from China-based employees and partners with firewalls and governance controls. The data sharing continued up until TuSimple\u2019s deadline to comply with the agreement six months later, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence that the Journal viewed.\n\nA subsequent investigation with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) found the data sharing didn\u2019t technically violate the agreement, though TuSimple was fined for other infractions and paid a $6 million settlement without admitting fault, per the Journal.\n\nTechCrunch was unable to reach TuSimple, now CreateAI, for comment.\n\nStill, the saga of TuSimple\u2019s data transfers to China exposes the limits of U.S. safeguards meant to balance foreign investment with national security. And it\u2019s not just data that TuSimple has been trying to get across the border.\n\nThis latest revelation comes eight months after TechCrunch reported that some of TuSimple\u2019s shareholders were trying to block the company from transferring its U.S. funds \u2013 roughly $450 million at the time \u2013 to the company\u2019s Chinese subsidiary to fund a pivot to AI animation and content generation. That drama is still unfolding as one of TuSimple co-founders, Xiaodi Hou, fights in court for control over his voting shares so he can push for liquidation of the company. In December 2024, TuSimple officially rebranded to CreateAI.\n\nThe company has been embroiled in controversy since going public via IPO in 2021. TuSimple started as a China-backed startup founded in 2015 by Hou and Lu Chen, an entrepreneur with ties to Sina Corp. It quickly became an autonomous vehicle industry favorite, managing to raise around $2 billion from a mixture of Chinese and U.S.-based heavy hitters, and was one of the first in the U.S. to successfully complete a fully driverless run on public highways.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nTuSimple\u2019s plans took a turn for the worse amid internal struggles and federal investigations into the company\u2019s ties with China, leading to its decision to exit U.S. operations and voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January 2024. The goal was to restart self-driving operations in China, but both the CFIUS agreement and other court orders that barred the company from transferring assets \u2013 financial or otherwise \u2013 to China made it next to impossible to restart operations there, the company has told TechCrunch.\n\nThe Journal\u2019s reporting sheds light on a previously reported controversy regarding Hydron, a Chinese hydrogen trucking startup founded by Chen, which shared an office with TuSimple China. The overlap between Hydron and TuSimple was the subject of the 2022 CFIUS probe, during which TuSimple revealed that its employees spent paid hours working for Hydron in 2021 and shared confidential information with the company.\n\nAccording to documents the Journal viewed, TuSimple negotiated a deal in 2021 between Hydron and Foton to develop autonomous trucks. Foton, a subsidiary of state-owned BAIC Group, has an agreement with a Chinese military university to work on AV tech.\n\nThrough a combination of emails, Slack messages, and video calls, TuSimple sent partners technical instructions for server dimensions, brake designs, sensors, steering, power supply, and chips, per the Journal. Employees also routinely downloaded autonomy source code developed by their American counterparts.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions and competition with China rise, TuSimple\u2019s ties are serving as a cautionary tale for Washington that has helped drive a shift in U.S. policy, prompting stricter rules on Chinese-linked tech deals and fueling a broader push to block high-risk transactions outright.",

    "content": "Salesforce has acquired cloud data management firm Informatica in an $8 billion equity deal, marking a major move in its push to strengthen its AI and data infrastructure capabilities.\n\nThe announcement, made Tuesday, comes about a year after early rumors of the acquisition sent both companies\u2019 stock prices sliding. At the time, Informatica denied it was for sale, but a lot can change in a year.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Salesforce will pay $25 in cash per share for Informatica\u2019s Class A and Class B-1 common stock, adjusting for its prior investment in the company.\n\nInformatica was founded in 1993 and works with more than 5,000 customers across more than 100 countries. The company had a $7.1 billion market cap at the time of publication.\n\nThis acquisition will help bolster Salesforce\u2019s agentic AI ambitions, the company\u2019s press release stated, by giving the company more data infrastructure and governance to help its AI agents run more \u201csafely, responsibly, and at scale across the modern enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360, enabling autonomous agents to act with intelligence, context, and confidence across every enterprise,\u201d Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in the press release. \u201cThis is a transformational step in delivering enterprise-grade AI that is safe, responsible, and deeply integrated with the world\u2019s data.\u201d\n\nThe path to this deal began in April 2024, when reports surfaced that Salesforce was eyeing Informatica. The market reaction was swift \u2014 both companies\u2019 shares dipped on fears of a difficult integration or strategic mismatch. Informatica later issued a public statement denying any sale discussions. But what once seemed unlikely is now official.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
